The goal of this project was to implement a table ADT and use the hashtable data structure.

The application/client program used the table to organize picture files on a digital camera into different subjects(such as family, friends, etc.). 

The user enters a “key” (a subject in this case) and the hash function converts that into an index. 

The files used in this program were main.cpp (client program), table.h (header file for the table class), and table.cpp(contains the implementations of the functions in the table class). 

The hashtable with chaining as the collision resolution technique was used as the data structure.
