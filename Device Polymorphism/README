The goal of this project was to create an object oriented solution that would simulate the functionality of some devices that I use frequently. 

A main objective was to build an abstraction that will look and feel the same regardless of the underlying data structure used by the client program. 

This project contained 5 classes and 11 files.  

I picked three devices to implement functionality for, and those were the calculator, GPS, and the cellphone. 

I used pure polymorphism and dynamic binding to create a hierarchy that would support these devices. 

The base class was a device class that contained functions that would be common for a calculator, GPS, and a cellphone.
