For this project, I was using a BST (binary search tree) table abstraction and comparing the run-time efficiency to that of the hashtable that I used in Picture Organizer. 

The application/client program remains the same as in Picture Organizer (organizing picture files on a digital camera into different categories). 

The files used for this program are main.cpp (the client program), tree.h (header file for BST class), and tree.cpp (contains the function implementations of the BST class). 

The data structure used was a non-linear linked list.
