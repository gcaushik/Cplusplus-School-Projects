The goal of this project was to implement a table ADT and use the graph data structure. 

The application/client program used the graph to track requirements for a degree. 

For example, the user might use the graph to find out what classes are needed as prerequisites to take a certain class. 

The graph is basically a representation of a degree plan, where it tells you which classes you can take, and what sequence you can take to get your degree. 

The files used in the program were the client program (main.cpp), the header file for the graph class (graph.h), and the implementations of the functions in the graph class (graph.cpp). 

The data structure was basically an array of vertices where each vertex has a linear linked list of edges (an array of LLL).
